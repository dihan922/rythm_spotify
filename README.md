# Spythm

A nostalgic clone of the well-known Discord music bot, Rythm. This bot simulates the behavior of Rythm by utilizing Spotify for music playback.

## Disclaimer

This project is a rudimentary alternative for nostalgic purposes. It directly affects your Spotify playback, and the audio can be routed to a Discord channel using a virtual audio cable. Please note that this is not a perfect replacement for the original Rythm bot.

## Acknowledgments

This project is inspired by the original Rythm bot, which is now defunct. Credits to the Rythm team for their contributions to the Discord music bot community.

## Getting Started

   - Create a Spotify Developer App: [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications)
   - Note down your Client ID and Client Secret.

2. **Discord Developer App**
    - Create a Discord Developer App: [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
    - Note down your Bot Token.
    - Generate an OAuth2 URL for your bot and invite it to your server.

3. **Python and Pip:**

   - Install `pip` if you haven't already.

4. **Clone the Repository:**

   cd spythm
   ```

### Dependencies

## Usage

1. **Run the bot:**
